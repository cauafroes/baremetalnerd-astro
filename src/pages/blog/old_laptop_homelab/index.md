If you follow mainstream tech YouTube or Reddit's `r/homelab`, the standard advice for beginners usually sounds like this: *"Just buy a Raspberry Pi 5"* or *"Pick up a used Intel NUC off eBay for $100."*

If you live in South America, Southeast Asia, or anywhere outside North America and Europe, you already know the problem: **import taxes, shipping fees, and local markups make those "cheap" recommendations wildly expensive.**

A Raspberry Pi + power supply + case + microSD card often ends up costing the equivalent of a week’s (or month’s) minimum wage. 

The secret weapon for self-hosting on a tight budget isn't a single-board computer—it's an **old dual-core or quad-core laptop** lying in a closet or listed for cheap on local marketplaces.

## Why Old Laptops Beat Raspberry Pis for Homelabbing

### 1. Built-in UPS (Battery Backup)
Power grids in developing nations can be unpredictable. Brownouts and sudden outages will corrupt microSD cards on a Raspberry Pi in a heartbeat. A laptop comes with its own built-in Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS): **the battery**. Even an old battery that only holds 20 minutes of charge gives your server enough time to gracefully shut down or survive temporary voltage drops.

### 2. Built-in KVM (Keyboard, Video, Mouse)
When your home server loses network connectivity or you lock yourself out via firewall rules, single-board computers require you to unplug everything, find a spare monitor, and plug in an external keyboard. A laptop already has a screen, keyboard, and trackpad attached.

### 3. Extremely Low Power Consumption
Laptops are engineered specifically for power efficiency. A 7th or 8th Gen Intel Core i5 laptop running headless (with the lid closed or display off) idles at around **5W to 15W**. That keeps your monthly electricity bill virtually unchanged.

### 4. Cheaper Expansion Options
- **RAM:** Most older enterprise laptops (ThinkPads, Dell Latitudes, HP EliteBooks) have SODIMM slots, allowing cheap upgrade paths up to 16GB or 32GB using second-hand RAM sticks.
- **Storage:** You get native SATA or NVMe connectivity instead of relying on fragile USB-to-SATA adapters or slow microSD cards.

## The Ideal Hardware Candidates

Look for used business-class laptops on local platforms (Mercado Livre, Facebook Marketplace, OLX):

- **Dell Latitude** (5480, 5490, 7480)
- **Lenovo ThinkPad** (T470, T480, X270)
- **HP EliteBook** (840 G3 / G4)

Even models with cracked screens, dead webcams, or worn-out trackpads are perfect—you only care about the motherboard, CPU, RAM, and storage interface.

## Setting Up Your "Laptop Server": Step-by-Step Quickstart

### Step 1: Install a Headless OS
Skip heavy desktop environments like GNOME or KDE to save RAM and CPU cycles. Install **Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS** or **Debian 12**.

### Step 2: Handle the Lid Close Behavior
By default, Linux suspends when you close the laptop lid. You need to disable this so your server stays running with the lid shut.

Edit `/etc/systemd/logind.conf`:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/logind.conf
```

Uncomment or update these lines:

```ini
HandleLidSwitch=ignore
HandleLidSwitchExternalPower=ignore
HandleLidSwitchDocked=ignore
```

Save the file and restart the systemd-logind service:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart systemd-logind
```

### Step 3: Prevent Battery Swelling
If your laptop stays plugged into AC power 24/7, set a battery charge threshold in the BIOS/UEFI (if supported) to stop charging at 60% or 80%. This extends battery life and prevents thermal degradation.

### Step 4: Install Docker & Portainer
If your laptop stays plugged into AC power 24/7, set a battery charge threshold in the BIOS/UEFI (if supported) to stop charging at 60% or 80%. This extends battery life and prevents thermal degradation.

Get your services running in lightweight containers:

```bash
# Install Docker
curl -fsSL [https://get.docker.com](https://get.docker.com) -o get-docker.sh
sudo sh get-docker.sh

# Run Portainer Web GUI
sudo docker run -d -p 9000:9000 --name=portainer --restart=always \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  -v portainer_data:/data portainer/portainer-ce:latest
```

### What Can You Run On It?
An 8th Gen i5 laptop with 8GB or 16GB of RAM can comfortably host a dozen Docker containers simultaneously:

| Service | What It Does |
| ------- | ------------ |
| Pi-hole / AdGuard Home | Network-wide ad blocking and DNS control |
| Jellyfin | Local media server (supports hardware transcoding on Intel HD graphics) |
| Vaultwarden | Self-hosted password manager |
| WireGuard / Tailscale | Secure remote access back to your home network |

### Final Thoughts
You don't need a $500 mini PC or an overpriced Raspberry Pi to learn Linux, Docker, networking, or cybersecurity.

An old $50-$100 laptop sitting in a drawer isn't just a budget compromise—in terms of power redundancy, built-in display, and cost-to-performance ratio in developing nations, it's often better hardware for the job.
